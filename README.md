# site

My personal blog. You can access it at [zanehala.com](zanehala.com).

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the static assets from markdown.
This site is a little more complicated than it needs to be, using flask to serve up the assets, I had intentions of possibly hosting API's and other things.
