Hello, I'm Zane Hala, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/) on the Platform team.
I enjoy tinkering with all things from cars to computers and everything in between, as well as learning 
how things work and operate. This site is just a place to write down some of the interesting things I've 
come across along the way.
