Hello, I'm Zane Hala, I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/) in the Platform org,
and at the moment on the Build, Test and Release team.
I enjoy tinkering with all things from cars to computers and everything in between. I love learning
how things work and operate. This site is just a place to write down some of the interesting things I've
come across along the way.
